Part 1. Declarative CI/CD Pipeline

1. Set up a code repository:
Create a simple code repository (e.g., a Hello World application) on GitHub or any other Git hosting service.
2. Create a Declarative Jenkinsfile:
In the root of your code repository, create a file named "Jenkinsfile" (with no file extension) and define a simple declarative pipeline. The declarative pipeline should include stages for building, testing, and deploying the application.
3. Connect Jenkins to your Git repository:
Configure Jenkins to connect to your Git repository and set up a webhook to trigger the CI/CD pipeline when changes are pushed to the repository.
4. Run the Declarative Pipeline:
Push a change to your code repository and observe how Jenkins automatically triggers the declarative pipeline.
